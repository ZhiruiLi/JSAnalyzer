# JSAnalyzer
A toy analyzer for a JavaScript-like language.

This is a project of my software testing class, for more information,
see the [FinalReport](./report/FinalReport.md)

How to run:

To run the code, you need to install cabal and GHC, type the following
command in console:

```
> cabal run
```

There will be a prompt message:

```
"Please input JS file path:"
```

Input the file path and press enter,
you can see the result produced by the analyzer.
